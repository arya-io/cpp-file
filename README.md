## Introduction

This repository is designed to provide simple and easy-to-understand C++ programs for beginners. Each file focuses on fundamental concepts of C++ programming, including basic syntax, data structures, object-oriented programming, and more. The goal is to help new learners get comfortable with C++ and build a strong foundation for more advanced topics.

## Requirements

To run the C++ programs in this repository, you need the following:

- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- A code editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, CLion, Code::Blocks)

## Usage
